# Chess Game

[Heroku Link](https://floating-woodland-1046.herokuapp.com/)

I want to write a chess AI in javascript.

## Goals

* Use inheritance to implement chess pieces
* Have a clever AI with multiple difficulties
  * Use a smarter metric than just assigning point values to pieces that can be captured
* Practice Angular, use it to simplify the view
* Maybe implement a backend to allow for saved games or multiplayer games

## Tests

Unit tests are implemented with Jasmine. Use ```npm test``` to run the test server, and navigate to localhost:8080 to see the results.
