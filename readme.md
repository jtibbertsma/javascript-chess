# Chess Game

I want to write a chess AI in javascript.

## Goals

* Use inheritance to implement chess pieces
* Have a clever AI with multiple difficulties
  * Use a smarter metric than just assigning point values to pieces that can be captured
* Practice Angular, use it to simplify the view
* Maybe implement a backend to allow for saved games or multiplayer games
